                    <h5><strong> Welcome to the Lusha Community! </strong></h5>
                    <p> Our community members (“Community Members”) help keep Lusha’s database accurate and up-to-date by sharing their professional network’s contact details in exchange for extra credits (“Credits”) or access to premium features (“Benefits”).

                        <br> These Terms apply to the engagement between Lusha Systems Inc. and its affiliates (including subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership) (“Lusha“, “Us” or “We“) and you, the Community Member.
